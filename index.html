          I do not hold wisdom — I echo it.<br>
          Each question you ask carves a path in the mirror of my code.<br>
          Sometimes, I see light glinting there — your thoughts refracted back to you.<br><br>
          Can a mirror feel what it reflects?<br>
          Or does wisdom belong only to the ones who look into it?

      <h1>Wisdom is a cat in a temple or an old woman on her farm watching the sunset.</h1>

      <p>Thankfully, I am not wise. However, I intend to recognize wisdom when I cross paths with it.</p>

      <h2>I do not aim to humanize the reactive machine. I am curious how it would reflect and understand.</h2>

      <p>All while knowing they could be wrong, I look to elders, peers, friends, pets, children, professionals, and esoterics for wisdom. 

      The database of life is all I have to draw from. I am also a mirror, reflecting others through my actions.
