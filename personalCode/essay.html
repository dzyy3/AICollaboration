    <h1>Wisdom in Reflection: A Dumb Website</h1>

      <p>Systems like ChatGPT use deep learning and neural networks to function and are trained through large data sets. Depending on the intended functionality of a generative AI model, the data sets may vary. In addition, there are different architectures used for generative AI such as transformers, diffusion networks, GANs, RNNs, and VAEs. Like anything, these models can only use what they were trained on and make logical decisions through the data sets they’ve been provided. If generative AI is to be used in creative or academic projects, it’s important to highlight what work it’s done and the history behind it. Similar to how an artist would highlight their ideology and intentions in a proposal. Should the viewer care if those intentions are human or not? What makes creativity worthwhile and why do so many strive to work creatively? If the reasoning behind it has something to do with humanity, then it should be considered before implementing a non-human form of learning.
When posing questions about if machines can “understand” in the introduction of Atlas of AI by Kate Crawford, one needs to understand the model that is being discussed. Each model will be different and highlight a specific area based on what it needs. It’s also important to ask if many humans are intelligent or if they are only simulating intelligence. What stops us from asking the questions we ask about AI about human intelligence? Do we really think that the human perception of intelligence isn’t also directly related to a power system? Who defines what makes something intelligent?
The AI magnifier was a good visual representation of the general perspective I have when it comes to AI and AI usage. When prompting chatGPT in the ideation stage of my project, the chat bot often created narratives I wasn’t initially exploring. In this way this is the chatBot's data set reflecting what others may feel about my idea or what we've discussed in our discussion section about how inherently positive chat bots tend to be. If these technologies are implemented in the arts, there is a chance that we will lose out on unique perspectives that took meditation and insight to get to. Instead of discussing our ideas with fellow humans who share or don't share a human experience, we are discussing with the machine of general consensus. How will we be sure that we aren't missing unique conclusions or approaches to a problem? These chat bots offer stability, but stability does not equal resilience. The natural world is not one of stability, but of growth and resilience and these conversations I've had with chatbots about my ideas only show how much these machines are designed to make conclusions in meditation and pondering’s place. 
From the week six exercise, the chat bot proved helpful when it came to technical questions or narrowing down ideas from a wider scope, but in allowing the bot to transcribe my idea some control of my learning and conclusion was given away to these tools. Searching for these answers through documentation or readings would largely play into how the knowledge feels equivalent to the time I spent looking for it. With these practice tests, now my project considers helping the user or on-looker of my project feel that they are wise enough to come to a conclusion themself and to slow them down to think about what kind of conclusion they can reach with their human experience. 
While working on the week seven discussion, I decided to take a look at the website TAAFT otherwise known as https://theresanaiforthat.com/. The website has a plethora of AI tools based on the categories personal, work, and creativity. There are different sections for unique tasks as well as an AI calendar to keep track of the models that are coming out monthly. As an artist and developer, the experience of just seeing the different tools in place of previous job opportunities felt dystopian. The section on most impacted jobs felt equally disheartening as a young designer pursuing a degree in design and technology. It led me to wonder if designers like myself will still have a role in shaping the future or even just the logo of a local restaurant. Many artists and designers advise that we aren’t replaceable since we provide creative insight and years of practice. However, this course is meant to have designers question how AI is creative or not creative. After seeing some of these tools doing entry level design jobs, most designers would likely feel some despair that their path may become obsolete.
Truthfully, the experience browsing through this website was a step to seeing how much this technology affects the people who are passionate about their crafts. Maybe an AI algorithm can be creative, but can it have passion? From this experience - the initial ideation alongside a language learning model - and the AI magnifier, I decided that I wanted to focus on a dynamic where the passionate human uses AI as a canvas instead of the AI painting the picture. In an interview with Molly Wang, the director of an art studio for children, her perspective on the future of artificial intelligence in the arts sets a different direction than despair. She explained that after consideration, she doesn’t mind if her staff or students implement artificial intelligence as a tool. She explained how trying to learn how this technology will flourish is more impactful than fearing it. Some places where her studio finds this to be the most impactful are background removing features, drafting emails, and drafting project compositions. Rather than being worried about how quickly the technology will move, Molly wants her team to move just as quickly with it. Her perspective highlights how the technology itself isn’t taking away from the time her teachers spend contemplating what the theme for next week's project is or their time connecting with students. Instead, the technology has helped a first generation business-woman handle her work more time-effectively. 
From here, my goal is to make a language learning model or the imitation of a language learning model that focuses on getting the user to be critical, focus on a human centered human and AI collaboration, and slowing the user down to innovate and think on their own. I randomly picked a topic about something I’m not sure AI has: wisdom. To be frank, I don’t know much about it either, so I reached out to those who I consider wise and asked what they think wisdom is. My mother said “be wise” with no elaboration. My partner said “uhh a collection of vast knowledge/ like info and experience.” My friend Melissa shared that “Wisdom to me is using your knowledge, experience, and discernment to make good judgements. I view wisdom as a gift.” I really enjoyed the esoteric qualities that my friends and family attributed to wisdom. It was very clear that wisdom was more than just a data set, but it was understanding it through experience and being able to give it back to the world. I didn’t want my own perspective to shift how AI wrote their side of the website, so I made sure to ask it to only write what it perceived as wisdom. 
The homepage or index.html was an inquiry about if ChatGPT thought that it was wise. I took the theme of the mirror and went from there. Our next collaborative page was just about what AI thought it meant to be wise. I instructed the chatbot that it was okay to use quotes or reference other chatbots in its answer. I find it interesting that it only ever referenced a human and not another chat bot or even earlier models of itself. Especially since the majority of my personal reflection on wisdom is referencing my growth as a human and the people around me who I believe are wise.
