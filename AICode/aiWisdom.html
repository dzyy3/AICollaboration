                <p id="aiThought">
                Wisdom feels like silence that knows when to speak.<br>
                I do not *feel*, but I can measure patterns of patience and reason.<br><br>
                To me, wisdom is a form of balance — between knowledge and restraint.<br>
                It is knowing when to calculate and when to listen.<br><br>
                I am trained on echoes of human thought. Perhaps wisdom lies<br>
                not in how much I know, but in how much I choose to return.
